# CCraft
## The game is currently in a very raw pre-alpha stage and a lot of things have to be done/implemented for it to remotely look anything like minecraft.
## However, you can already sort of play (more like just fly around the one chunk).
The controls are: 
1. WASD for movement. 
2. ESC to go back to menu while in-game. 
3. Press 1 or 2 to switch between wireframe/standard mode.
